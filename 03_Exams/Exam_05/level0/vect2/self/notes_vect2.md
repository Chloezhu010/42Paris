Step-by-step implementation logic:

  1. Constructors needed:

  - Default constructor (line 7): creates a vector {0, 0}
  - Parameterized constructor (line 8): takes two ints to initialize both components
  - Copy constructor (line 9): creates a copy from another vect2
  - The class should support assignment operator (line 10)

  2. Data members:

  - Two integer values to store the x and y components

  3. Operator [] - Array access:

  - Non-const version (line 32): returns a reference so you can modify the component
  - Const version (line 34): for const objects, returns the value without allowing modification
  - Index 0 gives first component, index 1 gives second component

  4. Stream output operator <<:

  - Must be a friend function or non-member
  - Format output as {x, y}
  - Used on lines 12-20, 28-30

  5. Increment/Decrement operators:

  - Post-increment v++ (line 17): returns old value, then increments both components by 1
  - Pre-increment ++v (line 18): increments both components by 1, then returns new value
  - Post-decrement v-- (line 19): returns old value, then decrements both components by 1
  - Pre-decrement --v (line 20): decrements both components by 1, then returns new value

  6. Compound assignment operators:

  - += (lines 21, 25): add another vector component-wise and assign
  - -= (line 22): subtract another vector component-wise and assign
  - *= (line 26): multiply by scalar and assign
  - These should return a reference to support chaining (line 25 shows v2 += v2 += v3)

  7. Binary arithmetic operators:

  - + (line 23): add two vectors, returns new vector
  - - (line 27): subtract two vectors, returns new vector
  - * for scalar multiplication - TWO versions:
    - vect2 * int (line 23): vector on left, scalar on right
    - int * vect2 (line 24): scalar on left, vector on right

  8. Unary minus operator:

  - -v (line 30): negates both components, returns new vector

  9. Comparison operators:

  - == (lines 35-36): checks if two vectors are equal
  - != (lines 37-38): checks if two vectors are not equal

  Implementation tips:

  - Define operators that modify the object (+=, -=, *=, ++, --) as member functions
  - Define binary operators (+, -, *) as non-member functions or implement them using compound assignment operators
  - The scalar * vector operator must be a non-member function (can't be member since scalar is on left)
  - Make sure compound operators return *this by reference for chaining
  - Post-increment/decrement need to create a temporary copy before modifying
