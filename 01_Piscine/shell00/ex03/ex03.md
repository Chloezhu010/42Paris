// diff between public key and private key
private key: 
- typically ~/.ssh/id_rsa
- should be kept secret, never shared with anyone
- used to decrypt data that was encrypted with the corresponding public key
public key:
- typically ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
- can be shared openly or stored on remote servers
- used to encrypt data or to verify a signature created by the private key
