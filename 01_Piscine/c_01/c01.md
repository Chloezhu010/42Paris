// pointer manipulation: allow to directly access and modify memory addresses
// interact with data at a low level
// 1. dereference a pointer: allow to access the value stored at the memory address it points to, using * operator
// 1.1 pointer declaration: in a variable declaration, * indicates that the variable is a pointer type
// 1.2 dereferencing: * dereference a pointer, aka it accesses the value stored at the address that the pointer points to
// 1.3 & is to obtain the memory address of a variable
int x = 42;
int *ptr = &x; // ptr now holds the address of x, *ptr can access the value at the address of x
printf("%d", *ptr); // output 42

// using analogy to understand
// memory as a warehouse: 
Address: This is like a label on the black box. It tells you where to find the box.
Pointer: Think of this as a note with the label (address) of a specific black box written on it. It doesn't contain the value itself, just information on where to find it.
Dereferencing: This is the act of opening the black box that the pointer refers to and accessing its contents.


// *nbr is an intger pointer

void ft_ft(int *nbr){ // the function receives a note with the black box's address
  *nbr = 42; // deference the pointer: use the address on the note to find the correct black box, open it, and replace its content with 42
}

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
  int n; // create a new black box
  n = 4242; // put 4242 inside the black box
  printf("%d\n", n); // open the box and reads its content 42424
  ft_ft(&n); // we pass the address of the box to the function ft_ft, inside the function, we change its content to 42
  printf("%d\n", n); // when reopen the box, it reads 42


# ex01

void ft_ultimate_ft(int *********nbr){
  *********nbr = 42;
}

# ex02

void ft_swap(int *a, int *b){ // the function receives 2 notes with the address of black box a, and black box b
  int c;
  c = *a;
  *a = *b;
  *b = c;
}

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void){
  int a;

  a = 2;
  b = 4;
  printf("%d & %d", a, b);
  ft_swap(&a, &b);
